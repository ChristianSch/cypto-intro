            might not yield the same result, meaning it is possibly randomized. $:=$ is
            used for deterministic assignments. $=$ is used for mathematical equality.</p>

            <h4 class="definition" id="def-pk">Private-key Encryption<a
                    class="anchor-link" href="#def-pk"></a></h4>
            <p>For a <em>message space</em> $M$ the private key encryption scheme is
            defined by a number of algorithms:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Gen: the key generation algorithm yielding $k$</li>
                <li>Enc: the encryption algorithm taking key $k$, message $m \in M$
                    as input. Outputs ciphertext $c$: $c \leftarrow \text{Enc}_k(m)$</li>
                <li>Dec: the decryption algorithm takes key $k$, ciphertext $c$ as input,
                    yielding either $m$ or an <em>error</em>: $m := \text{Dec}_k(c)$</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Any encryption scheme is required to satisfy the following correctness
            requirement:
            $\forall m \in M$, $k$ given by $\text{Gen}: \;\;\;
            \text{Dec}_k(\text{Enc}_k(m)) = m$</p>

            <h4 class="example" id="ex-shift">Example: The Shift Cipher<a
                    class="anchor-link" href="#ex-shift"></a></h4>
            <p>Considering the encryption of english text (only lower case characters).
            <code>a</code> is associated with $0$, <code>b</code> with $1$ and so on.
            $k \in \{1,2,…,25\}$. To encrypt using the key $k$, shift every
            letter of the plaintext message by $k$ positions (with wraparound). Decryption
            is just the reverse operation.</p>

            <p>More formally, the scheme can be defined as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>$M = \{$ strings over lowercase English alphabet $\}$</li>
                <li>$\text{Gen}$: choose uniformly $k\in\{0,…,25\}$</li>
                <li>$\text{Enc}_k(m_1, …, m_t)$: output $c_1,…,c_t$ where
                    $c_i := \left[ m_i + k \mod 26 \right]$</li>
                <li>$\text{Dec}_k(c_1,…,c_t)$: output $m_1, …, m_t$ where
                    $m_i := \left[c_i - k \mod 26\right]$</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Note that the scheme is not safe as an attacker can simply try all possible
            keys. This assumes however, that the attacker does know which scheme was used
            in the first place.</p>

            <h4 class="definition" id="def-kp">Definition: Kerckhoff's Principle<a
                    class="anchor-link" href="#def-kp"></a></h4>
            <p>The encryption scheme itself is not secret. The only secret is the key
            which must be chosen at random and kept secret. This principle is
            subject to controversion. Arguments in favor of this principle however
            include that it is easier to change the key than to change the algorithm,
            that it is easier to keep the key secret than the algorithm for two
            participators. Additionally it is easier to deploy and its open approach
            leads to public validation if the algorithm is known.</p>

            <h4 class="definition" id="def-sksp">Definition: Sufficient Key Space Principle<a
                    class="anchor-link" href="#def-sksp"></a></h4>
            <p>A too small key space for an encryption scheme is vulnerable to
            exhaustive-search attacks. However, large key spaces do not guarantee
            security.</p>

            <h4 class="example" id="ex-vc">Example: The Vigenère Cipher<a
                    class="anchor-link" href="#ex-vc"></a></h4>
            <p>The key is now a string, not just a character. To encrypt a message the
            characters are shifted by the respective character of the key, which is
            repeated in a wrap around manner for messages longer than the key. Decryption
            is again just the reverse operation.</p>
            <p>The key space for this scheme with a key size of $14$ is
            $26^{14} \approx 2^66$ which renders brute-force search attacks useless. The
            scheme however is not secure as it can be attacked differently.</p>
            <p>Suppose a key of length 14. Then every 14th character in the ciphertext
            was shifted the same amount. Together with plain text letter frequencies the
            following algorithm can be applied:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Look at every 14th character, starting with the first</li>
                <li>Let $\alpha$ be the most common character appearing in this portion
                    of the ciphertext</li>
                <li>Most likely, this character corresponds to the most common plaintext
                    character $e$. Guess the first character of the key
                    is $\alpha - e$</li>
                <li>Repeat for remaining positions</li>
            </ul>

            <p>There are better (but more complicated) attacks available for this scheme,
            however this attack will work for long enough Vigenère ciphers.</p>
